# DPS MUN 2025 Rules of Procedure - The Complete Mastery Guide

Understanding the Rules of Procedure (ROP) is the difference between being a passive participant and becoming a committee leader. These rules are not just formalities - they are strategic tools that can elevate your performance, help you control committee flow, and demonstrate diplomatic excellence. Master these procedures to not just participate, but to dominate your committee experience.

## Phase 1: Committee Initialization - Setting Your Foundation

### Roll Call - Your First Strategic Decision

Every committee session begins with **Roll Call**, which is far more than simple attendance - it's your first strategic decision that affects your entire committee experience. When the Executive Board calls your country's name, you must respond with one of two carefully chosen stances:

**Option A: "Present"** 
- **Strategic Advantage:** Maximum voting flexibility during final documentation
- **What it means:** You can vote Yes, No, or Abstain on the final resolution
- **When to choose:** When you want to keep all diplomatic options open, especially if your country has complex relationships with the agenda topic
- **Advanced tip:** This shows diplomatic sophistication and allows for nuanced positions

**Option B: "Present and Voting"**
- **Strategic Advantage:** Demonstrates decisive leadership and commitment
- **What it means:** You can ONLY vote Yes or No on final documentation (abstaining is prohibited)
- **When to choose:** When your country has a clear, unwavering position on the agenda
- **Advanced tip:** This signals to other delegates that you're serious about taking action and can make you an attractive coalition partner

### Establishing the Agenda - The Democratic Foundation

The agenda establishment process occurs when multiple topics are available for committee discussion. **Formal Motion:** "The delegate of [COUNTRY NAME] would like to establish the agenda [SPECIFIC AGENDA TOPIC] for the session 20XX-XX of [COMMITTEE NAME]."

**Advanced Strategic Understanding:**
- This motion only occurs when committees have multiple agenda options
- The country making this motion often becomes viewed as a committee leader
- In most DPS MUN 2025 committees, the Executive Board pre-establishes the agenda
- If you have the opportunity to make this motion, prepare a brief justification for why your proposed agenda should take priority

**Why This Matters:** The delegate who successfully establishes the agenda often sets the tone for the entire committee and is seen as taking initiative from the very beginning.

## Phase 2: The General Speakers List - Your Primary Platform

### Understanding GSL Dynamics

The General Speakers List (GSL) is where diplomatic careers are made or broken. This is your primary opportunity to present your country's position, demonstrate knowledge, and establish yourself as a key player in committee deliberations.

**Proper Motion Format:** "The delegate of [COUNTRY] would like to establish the general speakers list on the given agenda for the default time for each speaker being 90 seconds."

### Time Selection Strategy

**60 Seconds (Short Format):**
- **Advantages:** Forces concise, impactful statements; keeps committee energy high
- **Disadvantages:** Limited time for comprehensive policy presentation
- **Best for:** Experienced delegates who can maximize impact in minimal time

**90 Seconds (Recommended Standard):**
- **Advantages:** Optimal balance of comprehensive content and committee pacing
- **Disadvantages:** None - this is the sweet spot for most delegates
- **Best for:** Most delegates, especially those who want to present detailed positions

**120 Seconds (Extended Format):**
- **Advantages:** Maximum time for detailed policy presentation and solution development
- **Disadvantages:** Can slow committee momentum; some delegates may lose focus
- **Best for:** Complex topics requiring extensive background explanation

**Advanced GSL Strategy:** The time you propose often reflects your confidence level. Experienced delegates might propose 60 seconds to show they can be impactful quickly, while newer delegates might benefit from 90 seconds for thorough preparation.

### Mastering GSL Content - The Four Pillars

**Pillar 1: Country Position Analysis**
- Present your country's official diplomatic stance on the agenda
- Reference specific government policies, international agreements, or historical positions
- Demonstrate deep understanding of your country's national interests
- **Advanced tip:** Mention specific dates, policy names, or international frameworks to show preparation depth

**Pillar 2: Global Context and Perspectives**
- Analyze how the issue affects different regions, economic systems, or political blocs
- Reference other countries' positions to show comprehensive understanding
- Identify common ground and areas of potential consensus
- **Advanced tip:** Group countries by similar positions to show coalition-building awareness

**Pillar 3: Solution-Oriented Approach**
- Present specific, actionable solutions rather than general statements
- Explain implementation mechanisms and timeline expectations
- Address potential challenges and how they can be overcome
- **Advanced tip:** Reference successful precedents from similar international situations

**Pillar 4: Historical Context and Relevance**
- Connect current issues to historical events or previous international responses
- Demonstrate understanding of how past actions have shaped current circumstances
- Show lessons learned from previous diplomatic efforts
- **Advanced tip:** Use specific dates and outcome statistics to demonstrate research depth

## Phase 3: Strategic Time Management - The Yielding System

### The Art of Yielding - Maximizing Your Impact

When you finish your GSL speech with time remaining (typically 10-20 seconds from your allocated time), you have three strategic options that can significantly impact your committee standing:

### Option 1: Yield to Another Delegate - Building Alliances

**How it works:** Transfer your remaining time to another specific delegate who accepts the additional speaking opportunity.

**Strategic Applications:**
- **Coalition Building:** Give time to potential allies to strengthen relationships
- **Information Gathering:** Yield to delegates whose positions you want to hear more clearly
- **Power Sharing:** Demonstrate diplomatic courtesy to important regional powers
- **Mentor Recognition:** Yield to experienced delegates you want to learn from

**Advanced Protocol:** Always ask delegates privately before your speech if they would accept potential yielded time. This prevents embarrassing public rejections and shows sophisticated diplomatic planning.

**Pro Tip:** Keep a mental list of 2-3 delegates who have indicated willingness to accept yielded time, ranked by strategic importance to your positions.

### Option 2: Yield to the Executive Board - Demonstrating Confidence

**How it works:** Give your remaining time to the committee chairs, who decide how to utilize it.

**Strategic Applications:**
- **Question Preparation:** Chairs often ask clarifying questions about your speech
- **Authority Recognition:** Shows respect for committee leadership
- **Confidence Display:** Indicates you're prepared to defend your positions
- **Time Management:** Simple option when other yields aren't strategically beneficial

**Advanced Strategy:** Use this yield when you've made controversial or complex statements that might benefit from Executive Board clarification or when you want to demonstrate that you can handle impromptu questioning.

### Option 3: Yield to Points of Information (POI) - The Championship Move

**How it works:** Open yourself to questions from other delegates about your speech content.

**Why This is SUPERIOR:**
- **Scoring Advantage:** Your evaluation score cannot decrease if you can't answer, but increases significantly with correct responses
- **Leadership Demonstration:** Shows confidence in your knowledge and preparation
- **Engagement Catalyst:** Often generates the most dynamic committee interactions
- **Knowledge Display:** Allows you to showcase preparation beyond your planned speech

**Advanced POI Strategy:**
- **Anticipate Questions:** Before speaking, mentally prepare for 3-5 likely questions
- **Bridge Technique:** If you don't know an answer, acknowledge it honestly, then bridge to related information you do know
- **Counter-Question Setup:** Use POI responses to ask your own questions back, turning defense into diplomacy
- **Coalition Building:** Use answers to identify delegates with similar or complementary positions

**Master-Level POI Tactics:**
- Thank the delegate asking the question by name to show attention to detail
- Reference specific parts of your speech when answering to show consistency
- Connect your answers to broader committee themes to demonstrate big-picture thinking
- End strong answers with invitations for further dialogue outside formal session

## Phase 4: Parliamentary Tools - Your Tactical Arsenal

Understanding and strategically using parliamentary points separates novice delegates from committee leaders. These are not just procedural formalities - they are tactical tools for information gathering, error correction, and strategic positioning.

### Point of Parliamentary Enquiry - Your Information Gateway

**Purpose:** Address questions or concerns directed to the Executive Board about committee procedures, rules, or administrative matters.

**Strategic Applications:**
- **Position Tracking:** "What is my current position on the General Speakers List?"
- **Procedural Clarification:** "What is the specific format required for draft resolution submission?"
- **Time Management:** "How much time remains in the current session?"
- **Rule Interpretation:** "Are pre-written working papers allowed during unmoderated caucus?"

**Advanced Usage:**
- Use this point to demonstrate your engagement with committee procedures
- Ask questions that benefit the entire committee, positioning yourself as helpful
- Time your enquiries strategically - not during high-energy debate moments
- Frame questions to show sophistication: "Could the Executive Board clarify the specific citation format preferred for substantial chits?"

**Professional Protocol:** Always phrase these as genuine questions seeking clarification, never as challenges to Executive Board authority.

### Point of Personal Privilege - Your Comfort and Participation Tool

**Purpose:** Address personal needs that affect your ability to participate effectively in committee proceedings.

**Common Applications:**
- **Technical Issues:** "I am unable to hear the current speaker clearly"
- **Physical Needs:** "I need to briefly leave the committee room"
- **Equipment Problems:** "My internet connection is unstable and affecting my participation"
- **Documentation:** "I did not receive the background guide referenced by the previous speaker"

**Advanced Strategy:**
- Use sparingly to maintain credibility - this isn't for minor inconveniences
- Be specific about the issue and, when possible, suggest solutions
- Time these appropriately - never during crucial votes or heated exchanges
- Consider whether the issue can be resolved without interrupting committee flow

**Professional Approach:** Frame these as seeking accommodation to maintain high participation standards, not as complaints about committee management.

### Point of Order - Your Accuracy and Integrity Tool

This is the most sophisticated and potentially impactful parliamentary point. It maintains committee accuracy and demonstrates your attention to detail and commitment to factual integrity.

### Procedural Fallacy - Protecting Committee Integrity

**When to Use:** When an Executive Board member makes an error in committee procedure or rule implementation.

**Examples:**
- Chair incorrectly applies voting procedures
- Executive Board miscounts votes or misunderstands motions
- Procedural rules are applied inconsistently

**Strategic Approach:**
- Be absolutely certain you are correct before raising this point
- Present the correction respectfully, focusing on procedure, not personalities
- Reference specific rules or precedents when possible
- **Example:** "Point of Order: Procedural fallacy. The chair indicated that amendments require simple majority approval, but according to our committee's Rules of Procedure, amendments require a two-thirds majority vote."

**Advanced Protocol:** Only use this when the error significantly impacts committee fairness or accuracy. Minor procedural variations often fall within chair discretion.

### Factual Fallacy - Your Fact-Checking Superpower

**When to Use:** When a delegate makes a demonstrably incorrect factual statement during their speech.

**The Proper Format:**
1. Wait for the delegate to finish speaking completely
2. Raise your placard and state: "Point of Order: Factual fallacy"
3. Present your correction using this exact format: "The delegate of [COUNTRY] stated, quote '[EXACT INCORRECT STATEMENT]' unquote. However, [CORRECT INFORMATION WITH SOURCE]."

**Real Example:**
"Point of Order: Factual fallacy. The delegate of India stated, quote 'Donald Duck is the president of USA' unquote. However, Joe Biden is the current president of the United States, having assumed office on January 20, 2021."

**Advanced Fact-Checking Strategy:**
- **Source Preparation:** Always have credible sources ready to support your correction
- **Timing Precision:** Wait until the speaker completely finishes - interrupting is never acceptable
- **Professional Tone:** Focus on correcting information, not embarrassing the delegate
- **Strategic Selectivity:** Only correct significant factual errors that impact committee understanding

**Master-Level Approach:**
- Keep detailed notes during speeches to catch factual inconsistencies
- Prepare corrections that include context: "According to the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 passed in October 2000..."
- Use corrections as opportunities to provide additional relevant information
- Follow up privately with delegates you've corrected to maintain diplomatic relationships

**CRITICAL RULE:** All points must be raised during natural speaking pauses or committee transitions. Never interrupt a delegate's active speaking time. This rule is inviolable and demonstrates respect for diplomatic protocol.

## Phase 5: Committee Flow Control - Motions and Caucuses

Understanding motions is essential for committee leadership. These tools allow you to direct committee energy, focus discussions, and demonstrate procedural sophistication that separates advanced delegates from beginners.

## Moderated Caucus - The Focus Tool

### Understanding Moderated Caucus Strategy

const moderated caucus is your tool for laser-focused committee discussion. While the GSL allows broad position presentation, moderated caucuses drive specific solution development and targeted consensus building.

**Proper Motion Format:** "The delegate of [YOUR COUNTRY] would like to suspend the formal debate and move into a moderated caucus on the topic '[SPECIFIC FOCUSED TOPIC]' for the total time being 20 minutes, each speaker getting 60 seconds."

### Advanced Topic Selection Strategy

**Solution-Focused Topics:**
- "Implementation mechanisms for AI governance frameworks"
- "Specific funding sources for debt relief initiatives"
- "Enforcement procedures for human rights accountability"

**Geographic Focus:**
- "Regional approaches to plastic pollution in Southeast Asia"
- "Middle Eastern perspectives on conflict resolution"
- "African Union coordination on humanitarian response"

**Stakeholder Analysis:**
- "Private sector roles in technology regulation"
- "Civil society integration in policy development"
- "International organization coordination mechanisms"

### Strategic Timing for Moderated Caucuses

**Early Committee Phase:** Use broad topics to understand delegate positions and identify potential coalitions
- "Global perspectives on the current crisis"
- "Historical precedents for similar international challenges"

**Middle Committee Phase:** Focus on specific solution development
- "Concrete implementation timelines for proposed policies"
- "Resource allocation strategies for international cooperation"

**Late Committee Phase:** Address remaining consensus gaps
- "Resolving disagreements on enforcement mechanisms"
- "Finalizing draft resolution language on contentious issues"

### Advanced Moderated Caucus Tactics

**The Strategic Question Approach:** Frame your topic as a question that requires collective problem-solving
- "How can we ensure technology transfer while protecting intellectual property?"
- "What specific benchmarks should measure our policy success?"

**The Building Block Method:** Use sequential moderated caucuses that build on each other
- First caucus: "Identifying root causes"
- Second caucus: "Evaluating potential solutions"
- Third caucus: "Implementation and monitoring"

**The Coalition Catalyst:** Use topics that naturally group like-minded delegates
- "Developing world perspectives on economic recovery"
- "Maritime nations' approaches to ocean conservation"

### Time and Speaking Duration Strategy

**20 Minutes Total Time:**
- Standard duration that maintains committee energy
- Can be decreased if topic is straightforward
- Can be extended through additional motions if productive

**60 Second Speaking Time:**
- Default duration that forces concise, focused contributions
- Cannot be increased per DPS MUN rules
- Can be decreased to 45 or 30 seconds for rapid-fire input sessions

**Advanced Time Management:**
- Monitor which delegates are contributing most effectively
- Use time extensions strategically when breakthrough discussions emerge
- End caucuses early if consensus is reached ahead of schedule

## Unmoderated Caucus - The Relationship Building Engine

### Understanding Unmoderated Caucus Power

The unmoderated caucus is where MUN magic happens. This is where coalitions form, deals are negotiated, creative solutions develop, and lasting diplomatic relationships are built. Master this format to become a committee power broker.

**Proper Motion Format:** "The delegate of [YOUR COUNTRY] would like to suspend the formal debate and move into an unmoderated caucus for the time being 20 minutes."

### Strategic Applications for Unmoderated Caucuses

**Coalition Architecture:**
- Identify delegates with compatible positions

- Find creative compromises that address multiple countries' concerns
- Suggest alternative approaches when discussions reach impasses
- Maintain positive relationships even with delegates who disagree with your positions

## Phase 6: Advanced Communication - The Chit System

The chit system is MUN's diplomatic messaging network. Master this system to build alliances, gather intelligence, coordinate strategies, and demonstrate sophisticated diplomatic communication skills that separate advanced delegates from novices.

### Understanding Chit Hierarchy and Impact

**Substantial Chits - Your High-Value Currency:**
These carry maximum weight in committee evaluation and demonstrate sophisticated policy thinking.

**Strategic Content for Substantial Chits:**
- Original policy proposals with specific implementation details
- Comprehensive analysis of agenda issues with supporting data
- Creative solutions that bridge different countries' positions
- Technical expertise that advances committee understanding

**Format Excellence:**
```
To: The Executive Board
From: [Your Country Name]

[Detailed policy content, analysis, or innovative solutions]
```

**Advanced Substantial Chit Strategy:**
- Time submissions when Executive Board attention is highest
- Include specific, actionable recommendations rather than general opinions
- Reference credible sources and data to support your positions
- Propose solutions that benefit multiple countries simultaneously

**Procedural Chits - Your Tactical Communication Tool:**
While less valuable than substantial chits, these serve important tactical functions in committee dynamics.

**Strategic Applications:**
- Coordinating with potential coalition partners
- Gathering information about other delegates' positions
- Setting up private negotiations during breaks
- Asking targeted questions that advance your understanding

**Format Precision:**
```
To: [Specific Delegate Name]
From: [Your Delegation Name]
Via: EB (when you want Executive Board transparency)

[Specific question, coordination request, or information exchange]
```

### Advanced Chit Communication Strategies

**The Intelligence Network Approach:**
Use procedural chits to gather strategic information:
- "What aspects of the debt relief proposal does your delegation prioritize?"
- "Would your country support a phased implementation timeline?"
- "Are there specific concerns we should address in our draft resolution?"

**The Coalition Building Method:**
Coordinate alliance strategies through targeted messaging:
- "Our delegations share similar positions on enforcement mechanisms. Would you be interested in collaborative draft resolution development?"
- "We're organizing a working group on implementation timelines. Would your delegation participate?"

**The Expert Consultation Strategy:**
Position yourself as a valuable resource through substantive chits:
- Share detailed research findings that benefit multiple delegations
- Offer technical expertise on complex agenda aspects
- Provide historical case studies that inform current discussions

### Professional Chit Etiquette

**Response Protocols:**
- Always acknowledge receipt of chits directed to you
- Respond thoughtfully to substantive questions
- Maintain professionalism even when declining requests
- Express appreciation for valuable information shared

**Information Management:**
- Keep detailed records of important chit exchanges
- Verify information received through chits with additional sources
- Respect confidentiality when explicitly requested
- Share credit appropriately when using others' ideas

**Strategic Timing:**
- Send substantial chits when Executive Board attention is focused on your topic area
- Use procedural chits during natural committee transition periods
- Avoid overwhelming other delegates with excessive messaging
- Coordinate sensitive communications during unmoderated caucus periods

## Phase 7: Documentation Excellence - Your Diplomatic Legacy

### Position Paper - Your Foundation for Success

The position paper is your opportunity to demonstrate preparation depth, policy sophistication, and diplomatic understanding before committee sessions begin. This document establishes your credibility and provides the foundation for all your committee contributions.

**Advanced Position Paper Architecture:**

**Header Section - Professional Presentation:**
```
[Strategic Document Title - Be Creative but Professional]
Committee: [Full Committee Name]
Agenda: [Complete Agenda Statement]

```

**Body Section - The Three Pillar Structure:**

### Pillar 1: Comprehensive Background Analysis

**Essential Components:**
- **Stakeholder Mapping:** Identify all parties affected by the agenda issue, including primary victims, secondary impact groups, international organizations, and regional powers
- **Damage Assessment:** Provide specific statistics, dates, and quantifiable impacts rather than general statements
- **Urgency Indicators:** Explain why immediate action is necessary, referencing escalating trends or imminent deadlines
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Demonstrate deep understanding by identifying underlying causes rather than just symptoms

**Advanced Writing Strategy:**
- Use specific data points: "Since March 2023, over 2.1 million refugees have..."
- Reference credible sources: "According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees data..."
- Connect local and global impacts: "While primarily affecting the Middle East region, this crisis has created economic ripple effects in..."
- Demonstrate complexity awareness: "The interconnected nature of this challenge involves economic, social, and security dimensions..."

### Pillar 2: International Response Evaluation

**Critical Analysis Framework:**
- **Policy Assessment:** Evaluate existing international agreements, UN resolutions, and multilateral initiatives
- **Implementation Gaps:** Identify where current policies fall short of their intended goals
- **Success Story Recognition:** Acknowledge where international cooperation has achieved positive results
- **Resource Allocation:** Analyze funding mechanisms and their effectiveness

**Sophisticated Approach:**
- Compare different international responses: "While the European Union's approach emphasizes sanctions, the African Union has prioritized diplomatic mediation..."
- Evaluate effectiveness metrics: "Despite $2.3 billion in international aid, poverty levels in affected regions have increased by 15%..."
- Identify best practices: "The Norwegian model of conflict resolution offers transferable lessons for this situation..."

### Pillar 3: National Position and Strategic Framework

**Your Country's Comprehensive Stance:**
- **Historical Context:** How your country's past experiences inform current positions
- **National Interest Analysis:** Why this agenda matters to your country's security, economy, or values
- **Policy Integration:** How your position fits within your country's broader international relations strategy
- **Contribution Capacity:** What specific resources, expertise, or leadership your country can provide

**Advanced Positioning Strategy:**
- Balance idealism with realism: "While [Country] strongly supports human rights principles, we recognize the practical challenges of enforcement in sovereign territories..."
- Address potential contradictions: "Although [Country] historically maintained neutrality, the unprecedented nature of this crisis requires active engagement..."
- Propose specific contributions: "[Country] is prepared to contribute $50 million in humanitarian aid and deploy 200 peacekeeping personnel..."

## Draft Resolution - Your Collaborative Masterpiece

The draft resolution represents the culmination of committee work and demonstrates your ability to transform discussion into actionable policy. This document will be your lasting contribution to addressing global challenges.

### Advanced Draft Resolution Architecture

**Header Excellence:**
```
[Committee Full Name]
Sponsors: [Countries that authored the document - limited to 3-5 for credibility]
Signatories: [Countries that support the document - gather 8-12 for strong backing]
Topic: [Complete agenda statement]
```

**Strategic Sponsor Selection:**
- Include major powers relevant to your agenda
- Balance geographic representation
- Ensure policy compatibility among sponsors
- Consider influence level within the committee

**Comprehensive Signatory Strategy:**
- Target countries whose support lends credibility
- Include both developed and developing nations
- Seek regional balance across all major areas
- Consider countries that might abstain rather than vote against

### Preambulatory Clause Mastery

Preambulatory clauses establish the factual and legal foundation for your solutions. Each clause should build toward justifying the operative clauses that follow.

**Advanced Preambulatory Structure:**

**Foundation Setting Clauses:**
- "Recognizing the fundamental principles established in the United Nations Charter regarding..."
- "Reaffirming the commitments made in [specific international agreement] signed on [date]..."

### Professional Formatting Standards

**Clause Numbering and Punctuation:**
- Preambulatory clauses end with commas (,)
- Operative clauses are numbered and end with semicolons (;)
- Only the final operative clause ends with a period (.)

**Language Precision:**
- Use active voice: "Establishes" rather than "Calls for the establishment of"
- Be specific: "$2.5 billion over three years" rather than "adequate funding"
- Include implementation details: "through quarterly reporting to the Economic and Social Council"
- Set clear timelines: "by December 2025" rather than "as soon as possible"
